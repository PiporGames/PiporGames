## Welcome to my GitHub profile. Don't expect greatness: I just goof around with things.

How to reach me: Discord @piporgames. Do not reach me anywhere else.  
Good with VB.NET, still trying C/C++, Python, Java, SQL, Bash.  
Some day I will be better at Blender, trust me.  
Languages: Spanish (Castillian), English.  
 
### Personal:
ES, Extremadura💚🤍🖤

(Currently studying) Software Engineering at UEx.  
Happy to help with anything I have done before. Maybe try a wonky experiment from time to time.
